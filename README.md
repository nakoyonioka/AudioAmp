# Stereo Audio Amplifier (TPA3144D2)

This project implements a stereo audio amplifier circuit suitable for driving passive speakers. It utilizes the efficient Class-D architecture of the TPA3144D2, known for its low power consumption and relatively simple implementation.

## Features

* **Amplifier IC:** Based on the Texas Instruments TPA3144D2 stereo Class-D audio amplifier.
* **Output Power:** Capable of delivering up to 6W(details depend on power supply voltage and load impedance - refer to TPA3144D2 datasheet).
* **Stereo Output:** Provides two independent channels for stereo audio amplification.
* **Input Interface:** Designed for line-level stereo audio input.
* **Volume Control:** Includes interface points for connecting external potentiometers for independent left and right channel volume control.
* **Power Input:** Standard connector for DC power supply.
* **Speaker Outputs:** Screw terminals for easy connection of passive speakers.
* **Shutdown/Standby Control:** Includes provision for controlling the amplifier's operational state.
